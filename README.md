**Sugar High** is a fast-paced 2D platformer developed in Unity as part of CSUMB's 438: Software Engineering.

You play as a sugar-crazed fox racing toward the candy shop — but beware: every sweet treat you collect powers you up *and* pushes you closer to a sugar crash!

## 🕹️ Gameplay Overview

- 🦊**Collect sugar** to increase your speed.
- 🍬**Avoid bad candy** that slows you down.
- ⚠**Balance the sugar high** — max it out and you'll be sent back to your last checkpoint!
- ⏱️**Race to the finish** — designed with speedrunning in mind, race against the clock to beat your previous best times.

A fun and chaotic platformer that’s all about *risk vs reward*.
